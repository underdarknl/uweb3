        The`url` is matched against the compiled patterns in the registered routes list.

        N.B. The rules are such that the first matching route will be used. There
        is no further concept of specificity. Routes should be written with this in
        mind. However when using the register_app method routes will be inserted at the start of the list
        to prevent matching the error handlers first, since these are present in the basepages class that is
        supplied at uweb3 initialization time.
